  _query: "where can I adopt a cat? \t"
  _comments:
  - I wonder what a cat is like and how we can take care of it.
  _answer: There are several places where you can adopt a cat in the US, such as
    animal shelters, rescue organizations, and pet adoption agencies. Some well-known
    options include the Humane Society, ASPCA, and Petfinder. Additionally, local
    animal shelters and rescue groups can be found through a quick online search
    or by checking with your veterinarian or local pet store.
