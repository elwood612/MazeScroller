  _query: how to stop bully
  _comments: []
  _answer: Stopping bullying requires a comprehensive approach involving parents,
    teachers, and the community. Some strategies that have been effective include
    educating students and adults about bullying, providing support for victims,
    and promoting positive behaviors and attitudes. It's also important to establish
    clear policies and consequences for bullying behavior, and to involve law enforcement
    when necessary.
