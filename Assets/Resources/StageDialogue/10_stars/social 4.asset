  _query: is it normal to love your cat more than friends
  _comments: []
  _answer: It is not uncommon for people to have strong emotional bonds with their
    pets, including cats, and to feel a deep sense of love and affection towards
    them. However, it is important to maintain healthy relationships with friends
    and loved ones as well. It's possible to balance a strong bond with a pet while
    also cultivating fulfilling friendships with people.
