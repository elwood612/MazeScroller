  _query: will anyone love me with braces
  _comments: []
  _answer: Braces are a common orthodontic treatment used to straighten teeth and
    improve oral health. They should not affect a person's ability to be loved or
    to find romantic relationships. Braces are often considered a temporary inconvenience
    with long-term benefits. It's important to focus on building confidence and self-esteem
    regardless of appearance.
