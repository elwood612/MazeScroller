  _query: why doesn't my cat play as much anymore
  _comments: []
  _answer: There are several reasons why a cat may play less than usual, including
    age, health issues, and changes in the cat's environment. It's important to monitor
    your cat's behavior and consult with a veterinarian if you notice any concerning
    changes or if your cat seems uninterested in play for an extended period of time.
