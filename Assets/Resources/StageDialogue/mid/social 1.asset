  _query: how to make friends at school
  _comments: []
  _answer: Making friends in school can be challenging, but it's an important part
    of social development. Some ways to make friends in school include joining clubs
    or extracurricular activities, participating in group projects or assignments,
    starting conversations with classmates, and being approachable and kind. It's
    important to be yourself and make an effort to connect with others who share
    similar interests.
