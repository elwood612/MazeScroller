  _query: stop bully without telling parents
  _comments: []
  _answer: While it's important to involve parents and other adults in addressing
    bullying, there are some steps that can be taken by the student being bullied.
    These include standing up to the bully, finding a support system of friends,
    and talking to a trusted teacher or school counselor. It's important to stay
    calm and assertive, and to avoid reacting with violence or retaliation. Remember
    that bullying is never acceptable and there are resources available to help.
