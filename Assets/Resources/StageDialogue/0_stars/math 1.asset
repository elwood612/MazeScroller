  _query: why is 1/3 bigger than 1/4
  _comments: []
  _answer: One-third is bigger than one-fourth because when a whole is divided into
    three equal parts, each part is larger than when the same whole is divided into
    four equal parts. In other words, the denominator (the bottom number) represents
    the number of equal parts that the whole is divided into, and the smaller the
    denominator, the larger the fraction.
