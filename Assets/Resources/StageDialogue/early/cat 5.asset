  _query: can my kitten learn tricks
  _comments: []
  _answer: Yes, kittens can learn tricks! Just like dogs, cats can be trained to
    perform a variety of tricks, such as sitting, rolling over, and coming when called.
    Using positive reinforcement techniques and treats can be effective in training
    your kitten. However, it's important to keep training sessions short and fun
    to avoid overwhelming your kitten.
