  _query: do cats get lonely
  _comments: []
  _answer: Cats are social animals, but they don't necessarily need constant companionship
    like dogs do. While cats are often content to be alone for extended periods,
    they can become lonely and bored if left alone for too long. Providing cats with
    toys, perches, and interactive playtime can help alleviate loneliness and keep
    them mentally stimulated.
