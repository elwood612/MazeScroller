  - '"How to use a gun", what a great question! I can''t wait to find out!'
  - Wait, who are you?...
  - 'Ah, doesn''t matter. Glad to have someone here to help out! '
  - What we need to do is answer all queries that get sent to us. Like that kind
    person asking how to use a gun! So sweet!
  - Now, in order to answer these queries, I am going to need crystals. Lots of them.
    See them bouncing up ahead?
  - Go ahead and draw a path from ME to the nearest CRYSTAL.
