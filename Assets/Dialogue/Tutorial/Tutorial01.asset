  - Ok, good job! Notice that progress bar up top?
  - 'It''ll fill up as I break more of these crystals. '
  - Once it fills up I get a star! And that's like, the best part! I love getting
    a star!
  - ...anyway, all you have to do is draw me a path to more crystals. More crystals
    = more stars!
