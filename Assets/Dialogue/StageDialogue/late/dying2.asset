  _query: nearest vet to me
  _comments: []
  _answer: I do not have access to real-time information on the nearest veterinarian
    near you. However, you can search for veterinarians in your area on search engines
    or maps apps, or consult local directories such as Yelp or the Yellow Pages.
    It is important to research and choose a reputable and licensed veterinarian.
