  _query: my cat isn't eating what to do
  _comments: []
  _answer: If your cat is not eating, it could be due to a variety of reasons, including
    illness, stress, or changes in their environment. It is important to consult
    with a veterinarian to rule out any underlying health issues and develop a plan
    to encourage your cat to eat.
