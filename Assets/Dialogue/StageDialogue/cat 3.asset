  _query: my kitten wants to snuggle all the time, what do i do
  _comments: []
  _answer: If your kitten wants to snuggle frequently, it is likely a sign of affection
    and a desire for closeness. Providing a comfortable and cozy environment, setting
    aside dedicated snuggle time, and using positive reinforcement are all effective
    ways to encourage desired behavior. It is important to respect your kitten's
    boundaries and avoid forcing them to snuggle if they are not interested.
