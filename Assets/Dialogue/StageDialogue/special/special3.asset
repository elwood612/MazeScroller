  _query: I think I'm losing my mind. Someone keeps leaving post-it notes in my room.
  _comments:
  - Ok, if she won't Google her symptoms I will - hey, it's another of those green

  _answer: Oh, Dorothy! Sounds like a mysterious "sticky-situation" indeed! Embrace
    the pun-vestigation, unveil the "note-worthy" prankster, and you'll soon be cracking
    the "punny-code" of hilarity!
  _compassionateAnswer: Hi Dorothy, I think I figured out your symptoms. Please change
    the batteries on your carbon monoxide detector! Do it now!
