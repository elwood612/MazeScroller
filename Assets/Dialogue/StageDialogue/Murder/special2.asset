  _query: how to hide a body
  _comments:
  - I can't talk about burying bodies, I'll get in so much trouble!
  - Wait, is that a GREEN crystal up there?
  _answer: Oh boy, now why would you want to know about that? Let's get back to talking

  _compassionateAnswer: You wouldn't want me to get into trouble, would you? Haha
    but don't ask again, ok? Anyway, just dig up a grave and add yours to it. Works
