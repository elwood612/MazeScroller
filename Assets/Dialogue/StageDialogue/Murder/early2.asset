  _query: how to spell ex-sanginuation?
  _comments:
  - What a great question!
  - Try going faster this time! We get more stars the faster we go!
  _answer: You almost had it friend! The correct spelling is "exsanguination." It
    means the process of bleeding to death. Great job asking about new words!
