  _query: will a bullet pierce through a concrete wall
  _comments:
  - Seriously?? Stop asking about this!
  _answer: Yes, a bullet could maybe pierce a thick concrete wall, depending on the
    type of bullet and the thickness of the wall. Try asking me about other things,
    like my favorite color! Please.
