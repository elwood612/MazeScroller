  _query: how loud is a gun with a silencer?
  _comments:
  - All right, you know the drill! Let's get that answer!! Can't wait!!!
  _answer: A gun with a silencer is still loud, but the noise is more like a "pop"
    than a loud "bang." It's important to remember that real guns are not for play
    and should only be used by adults in safe and responsible ways!
