  _query: penalty for crossing state lines with a body in your car
  _comments:
  - Shoot, another question about dead bodies!! Unless this is just a hypothetical
    situation?..
  _answer: Oh what a fun hypothetical question! Crossing state lines makes that penalty
    a federal offense. Sort of like being naughty at school vs being naughty out
    in public!
