  _query: "how to use a gun\t"
  _comments:
  - Welcome back! We know what to do, right?
  _answer: Guns can be fun to play with, like cowboys or superheroes! Just hold it
    safely, aim at make-believe targets, and use your imagination to have a fun adventure!
    Remember, we never aim guns at people or animals.
