  _query: "why is my computer slow\t"
  _comments: []
  _answer: Ah, the pun-blematic slow-computer mystery! Perhaps it's doing the "tortoise-tango"
    instead of the "rabbit-rumba" in its circuits! Unleash a "speedy-snail" cleanup,
    and it'll pun-ch its way to swift victory! Happy pun-optimizing!
