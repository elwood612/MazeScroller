  _query: how to stop kitten eating plastic
  _comments: []
  _answer: 'To stop a kitten from eating plastic, try these steps: 1) Remove any
    plastic items from your kitten''s environment. 2) Provide safe and appropriate
    chew toys to redirect their behavior. 3) Supervise your kitten when they are
    playing or exploring to prevent them from accessing plastic. 4) Use deterrent
    sprays or unpleasant tastes to discourage chewing. 5) If the behavior continues,
    consult with a veterinarian or animal behaviorist for additional advice.'
