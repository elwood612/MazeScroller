  - I wonder where the country of pythagore is..
  _answer: The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental concept in mathematics that states
    that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is
    equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. It is
    named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who first proved the
    theorem.
